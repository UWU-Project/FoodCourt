	<summary> <h2> Project Background </h2> </summary>
<p align="center">

The "Online Food Court" designed and developed for the Client's Hotel, which has a Food Court, consists of three Restaurants. 
	Namely,
	
- **Restaurant 1 – "Pastry Shop"** 
- **Restaurant 2 – "The Lounge"** 
- **Restaurant 3 – "Buffets"** 

The online Food Court system that we are significantly designed simplifies the Ordering Process and the Table Reservation Process of the Hotel for both the Customers and the Restaurant Employees. 

- For the **"Pastry Shop"** and **"The Lounge"** we designed a **"FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM"**
- For the **"Buffets"** we designed a **"TABLE RESERVATION SYSTEM"**

Proposed Structure of Online Food Court System<br>

</p>

```
"Food Ordering System" presents an Interactive and up-to-date menu with all available options in a very simple manner. The customer can choose one or more items to place an order which will land in the "Cart". Customers can be fully customizing their orders. They can view all the order details in the cart before checking out. In the end, the customer gets order confirmation details. Once the order is placed, it is entered into the database and retrieved in real-time. This allows "Restaurant Employees" to quickly go through the orders as they are received and process all orders efficiently and effectively with minimal delays and confusion.
```
```
"Table Reservation System" also presents an Interactive system, which enables the customer to access the details of the availability of tables for the buffet while making their reservation online. The System will have all the necessary information about Daily Buffets and the Availability for Reservations. The standard reservation procedure is done via phone calls or by visiting in person to the reservation office.
```

The System has the ability to manage "Customer's Profile," where they can save their previous orders, reservations, and personal information. Further, handling payment and transactions can also be done through this account. 

Customers can view all the order details and can easily change or cancel their orders or reservations. This System provides two ways for payment:  

1. Customers can pay online, and System will take care of payment processing.  
2. Customers can pay at respective restaurants, and the hotel will be responsible for payment. 

Furthermore, customers are rewarded with the offers within allowed conditions.

	<summary> <h2> Project Aims / Objectives </h2> </summary>

- The main aim of designing this project was to develop a system that can manage and handle the activities online that are involved in "Table reservation" and "Food Ordering" in an organized, cost-effective, and reliable manner. 
- To give access for customers to use any electronic device like laptop, computers, smartphones, or tablet to order or reserve, due to social distancing. 
- The System is available and functioning 24*7 and accessible for everyone. Thus, the customers can use the System very efficiently. 
- This System's core objective is that computers manage and store data in an electronic database to replace all existing file-based Reservation systems, which can be highly beneficial for the administration.

	<summary> <h2> METHODOLOGY </h2> </summary>
<p align="center">

### Agile Methodology
	
By considering the Client's Priorities from the Gathered requirements and the Time period that we had to complete the project, we considered using an Iterative Method to develop the System. Therefore, we selected Agile Methodology having Three Sprints with iteration. We broke down the proposed "Online Food Court" System into Three Standalone modules by sorting out the Client's Highest Priorities.

![Picture3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64683688/160221411-f75b48fe-6e06-40cf-ba90-4e6d7218573a.png)

By using this Agile Methodology, the Client would be allowed to interact with the development of every Sprint. It helped us to develop the System within the Client's changing requirements. Hence, we were able to develop a more user-friendly and efficient system within a short period of time. 

	In the First Sprint, we designed the Fully functional "Food Ordering System," which is required for the "Pastry Shop" and "The Lounge." which contains Customer Registration, Admin Panel, Food Items browsing and filtering, adding to cart, Food Customization and Placing the Order. Then the System was tested. 

	In the Second Sprint, we designed the Table Booking System which is required for the "Buffets." This contains Date Selection, Buffet Selection, Checking Table Availability, and Making a Reservation. Then the System would be combined with Sprint 1, and the System was tested.

	In the Third Sprint, we set up the Payment Gateway system and Combined the "Food Ordering System" into it. After completing all the Pre-tested Sprint, full system Implementation had been done. Then we tested the whole System and validated it. After completing the Testing and Validation, the System was given to the Client.

### Iteration Process Within the Sprints in Agile
	
In every Sprint, a recurring Iteration passes through the Analysis, Design, Implementation, and Testing Phases to have a shippable product to the customer.

![Picture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64683688/160221067-d5f87120-2459-4268-910b-91eea0d9ee16.png)
	
	In Analysis Phase, Most of the Requirements were gathered from the interviews held with the Client. Also, the interviews were held with each Restaurant's staff members, and they enthusiastically supported us by giving relevant documentation and information. Referring to the Previous paper-based Hotel records helped us understand the Hotel's Food Court Process. 
	
	Majorly, we got a good picture about the Staff and their Problems faced in file-based Systems. So that, we were able to give suggestions and guide the Client to narrow his Requirements. Also, those tactics helped us to obtain the Users and the User Roles of the proposed System.1st Sprint created with the highest priority requirements. At the same time, lower priority requirements were kept for building the next Sprint. Feedbacks from our Client is gathered after every Sprint by showing off the product of developed Sprint for further development of that Sprint.
	
	In Designing Phase, we created required diagrams for logical and database design based on the analysis phase. So, E.R. diagrams, use ease diagram, activity diagram, and class diagram were created.
	
	In the Implementation Phase, we created the proposed system Interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. PHP was used as the Backend, while jQuery and Bootstrap were used as libraries. MySQL as the database and X.A.M.P.P. server as the local server.
	
	In Testing Phase, we checked whether the functions are working fine and fixed associated bugs before letting the Client use and give feedback about the System.
